<h2> Subtleties of the program </h2>
<ul>
    <li> HashSet of all operations in Checkout in order to make the code more flexible : every operation is a different class </li>
    <li> The different HashSet in the program like "notes" for example are static it's easier to access to them in the operation class</li>
    <li> The different scripts can be use to compile, launch and execute the tests </li>
</ul>

<h2> Problems encountered</h2>
<ul>
    <li> We had to rethink our code from scratch in order to make it more flexible </li>
    <li> We had to simplify and modify the responsibilities of certain classes (such as Checkout) to respect the limitations of the project</li>
    <li> We had multiple problems about the package when we moved to Linux.</li>
</ul>
