<h2> Subtleties of the program </h2>
<ul>
    <li> HashSet of all operations in Checkout in order to make the code more flexible : every operation is a different class </li>
    <li> The different HashSet in the program like "notes" for example are static it's easier to access to them in the operation class</li>
    <li> The different scripts can be use to compile, launch and execute the tests </li>
</ul>

<h2> How does it works ? </h2>

Use the different scripts : <br />
./compile.sh to compile all the classes <br />
./launch.sh to launch the program  <br />
./test.sh if you want to run some tests <br />
./clear.sh to clear all the .class when you are done <br />
